          "Depending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different organisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.",
          "These sources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the body, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that can be used for the various molecular movements needed for maintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the body needs to grow.",

              "The food coming from the stomach is acidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.",
              "Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.",
              "Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes it difficult for enzymes to act on them.",
              "Bile salts break them down into smaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action.",

          "Diverse organisms do this in different ways â€“ some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely into carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not involve oxygen.",
          "In all cases, the first step is the break-down of glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called pyruvate.",
          "This process takes place in the cytoplasm.",
          "Further, the pyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide.",
          "This process takes place in yeast during fermentation.",
          "Since this process takes place in the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration.",
          "Breakdown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria.",
          "This process breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three molecules of carbon dioxide.",
          "The other product is water.",
          "Since this process takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic respiration.",
          "The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater than in the anaerobic process.",
          "Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen in our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is taken.",
          "Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a three-carbon molecule.",
          "This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during sudden activity causes cramps.",
          "The energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used to synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other activities in the cell.",
          "In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise to a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions taking place in the cell.",
          "Since the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic organisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen.",
          "We have seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large inter-cellular spaces ensure that all cells are in contact with air.",
          "Carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here.",
          "The direction of diffusion depends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of the plant.",
          "At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, $CO_2$ elimination is the major exchange activity going on.",
          "During the day, $CO_2$ generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence there is no $CO_2$ release.",
          "Instead, oxygen release is the major event at this time.",
          "Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the atmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen dissolved in water.",
          "Since the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared to the amount of oxygen in the air, the rate of breathing in aquatic organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms.",
          "Fishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the gills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood.",
          "Terrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for respiration.",
          "All these organs have a structure that increases the surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich atmosphere.",
          "Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide has to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine and delicate.",
          "In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed within the body, so there have to be passages that will take air to this area.",
          "In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air in and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.",
          "In human beings, air is taken into the body through the nostrils.",
          "The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by fine hairs that line the passage.",
          "The passage is also lined with mucus which helps in this process.",
          "From here, the air passes through the throat and into the lungs.",
          "Rings of cartilage are present in the throat.",
          "These ensure that the air-passage does not collapse.",
          "Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller and smaller tubes which finally terminate in balloon-like structures which are called alveoli (singularâ€“alveolus).",
          "The alveoli provide a surface where the exchange of gases can take place.",
          "The walls of the alveoli contain an extensive network of blood-vessels.",
          "As we have seen in earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten our diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result.",
          "Because of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded alveoli.",
          "The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body for release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is taken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported to all the cells in the body.",
          "During the breathing cycle, when air is taken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume of air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed and for the carbon dioxide to be released.",
          "When the body size of animals is large, the diffusion pressure alone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body.",
          "Instead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the lungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before releasing it.",
          "In human beings, the respiratory pigment is haemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen.",
          "This pigment is present in the red blood corpuscles.",

              "The heart is a muscular organ which is as big as our fist.",
              "Because both oxygen and carbon dioxide have to be transported by the blood, the heart has different chambers to prevent the oxygen-rich blood from mixing with the blood containing carbon dioxide.",
              "The carbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach the lungs for the carbon dioxide to be removed, and the oxygenated blood from the lungs has to be brought back to the heart.",
              "This oxygen-rich blood is then pumped to the rest of the body.",
              "Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs comes to the thin-walled upper chamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium.",

              "De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper chamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes.",
              "As the right atrium contracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates.",

              "Valves ensure that blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.",
              "The separation of the right side and the left side of the heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood from mixing.",
              "Such separation allows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the body.",
              "This is useful in animals that have high energy needs, such as birds and mammals, which constantly use energy to maintain their body temperature.",
              "Such animals, like amphibians or many reptiles have three-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing of the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood streams.",
              "Fishes, on the other hand, have only two chambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped to the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly to the rest of the body.",
              "Thus, blood goes only once through the heart in the fish during one cycle of passage through the body.",
              "On the other hand, it goes through the heart twice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double circulation.",
              "Arteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various organs of the body.",
              "Since the blood emerges from the heart under high pressure, the arteries have thick, elastic walls.",
              "Veins collect the blood from different organs and bring it back to the heart.",
              "They do not need thick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they have valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.",
              "The smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called capillaries.",
              "Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding cells takes place across this thin wall.",

              "A proper system of transportation is therefore essential in such situations.",
              "Plants do not move, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many tissues.",

              "Provided that the plant has an adequate supply of water, the water which is lost through the stomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels in the leaf.",
              "In fact, evaporation of water molecules from the cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water from the xylem cells of roots.",
              "The loss of water in the form of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is known as transpiration.",
