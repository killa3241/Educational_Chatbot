If the white crystals are moistened with water, the blue colour reappears, showing the water is part of the crystal structure. \n(c) Plaster of Paris is prepared by heating gypsum ($CaSO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$) at 373 K, causing it to lose water molecules. (The text does not provide the preparation equation, only the setting equation). \n(d) The setting of Plaster of Paris: $CaSO_4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}H_2O + 1\\frac{1}{2}H_2O \\rightarrow CaSO_4 \\cdot 2H_2O$."

          "The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater than in the anaerobic process.",
          "Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen in our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is taken.",
          "Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a three-carbon molecule.",
          "This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during sudden activity causes cramps.",
          "The energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used to synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other activities in the cell.",
          "In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise to a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions taking place in the cell.",
          "Since the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic organisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen.",
          "We have seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large inter-cellular spaces ensure that all cells are in contact with air.",
          "Carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here.",

          "The alveoli provide a surface where the exchange of gases can take place.",
          "The walls of the alveoli contain an extensive network of blood-vessels.",
          "As we have seen in earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten our diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result.",
          "Because of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded alveoli.",
          "The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body for release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is taken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported to all the cells in the body.",

    {
      "question": "What is the problem with oxygen delivery in large animals, and what is the solution? (2 marks)",
      "answer": "When the body size is large, diffusion pressure alone cannot take care of oxygen delivery. Instead, respiratory pigments (like haemoglobin) take up oxygen from the lungs and carry it to tissues that are deficient in oxygen."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is haemoglobin, and what property makes it essential? (2 marks)",
      "answer": "Haemoglobin is the respiratory pigment in human beings, present in the red blood corpuscles. It is essential because it has a very high affinity for oxygen, allowing it to transport oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues."

      "answer": "The first step, breakdown of glucose to pyruvate, occurs in the cytoplasm. After that: \n1. **Anaerobic (in Yeast):** In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide (fermentation). \n2. **Anaerobic (in Muscle):** In a lack of oxygen, pyruvate is converted into lactic acid (which causes cramps). \n3. **Aerobic (in Mitochondria):** In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is broken down in the mitochondria to give three molecules of carbon dioxide and water. This releases the most energy."

      "question": "Explain the mechanism of breathing in human beings (inhalation). (3 marks)",
      "answer": "When we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten our diaphragm. As a result, the chest cavity becomes larger. Because of this increase in volume, the pressure drops, and air is sucked into the lungs, which fills the expanded alveoli."

      "question": "Describe the path of air from the nostrils to the alveoli in humans, mentioning the function of two structures along the way. (3 marks)",
      "answer": "Air is taken in through the nostrils, where it is filtered by fine hairs and mucus. From here, it passes through the throat (where rings of cartilage prevent the air passage from collapsing) and into the lungs. Within the lungs, the passage divides into smaller tubes which finally terminate in balloon-like alveoli, where gas exchange happens."

      "question": "How are oxygen and carbon dioxide transported in human blood? (3 marks)",
      "answer": "Oxygen delivery in large animals cannot rely on diffusion alone. The respiratory pigment haemoglobin, which has a high affinity for oxygen, takes up oxygen in the lungs and carries it (in red blood corpuscles) to tissues. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than oxygen is, and hence is mostly transported in the dissolved form in our blood."

    {
      "question": "Describe the full process of gas exchange in humans, starting from the alveoli and including the transport of both oxygen and carbon dioxide. (5 marks)",
      "answer": "The alveoli provide the surface for gas exchange. \n1. **Oxygen Uptake:** Air in the alveoli is rich in oxygen. The walls of the alveoli have an extensive network of blood vessels. Oxygen is taken up by the blood. Diffusion pressure alone is not enough, so the respiratory pigment haemoglobin (in red blood corpuscles), which has a high affinity for oxygen, binds to it. This blood is then transported to all cells in the body, where haemoglobin releases the oxygen to tissues that are deficient. \n2. **Carbon Dioxide Release:** The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body for release into the alveoli. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water (blood plasma) than oxygen is, so it is mostly transported in the dissolved form. It diffuses from the blood into the alveoli, where it can be exhaled."

      "question": "Explain the mechanism of phototropism in a plant shoot. (3 marks)",
      "answer": "When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin is synthesised at the shoot tip. If light is coming from one side, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to bend towards light."

Other cells with the means to detect this compound can then recognise the information. This method is slower, but it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous connections, and it can be done steadily and persistently."

      "answer": "The response of a plant shoot to light (bending towards it) is called phototropism. This is a growth-related movement controlled by a plant hormone called **auxin**. \n1. Auxin is synthesised at the shoot tip. \n2. When light is coming from one side of the plant, the auxin hormone diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. \n3. This creates a higher concentration of auxin on the side of the shoot which is away from the light. \n4. This high concentration of auxin stimulates the cells on the shady side to grow longer. \n5. Because the cells on the shady side are growing longer than the cells on the light side, the plant appears to bend towards the light."

They are found in high concentrations in areas of rapid cell division, like fruits and seeds. \n4. **Abscisic acid:** This is a hormone that inhibits growth.

It ensures the maintenance of body design features that allow the organism to effectively use its particular niche. \n2. **Variation:** Variation is useful for the *long-term survival* of the species. If the niche is drastically altered (e.g., temperature increase), individuals without variation might be wiped out. But if some variations (e.g., heat resistance) are present in a few individuals, they have a chance to survive, ensuring the survival of the species over time."
